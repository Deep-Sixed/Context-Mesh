"""The graph an MCP server serves, and how it survives a restart.

One session per process is right for a stdio server talking to one local
client. It is not right for a shared service, and this file is where that
assumption is written down rather than implied.

A session on disk is a *directory*, not a file::

    session/
      session-000003.json    the manifest, and the commit point
      session.json           latest-manifest pointer for humans and older tools
      graph-000003.json      contextmesh.graph    v1 (contextmesh/graph.py)
      resolver-000003.json   contextmesh.resolver v1 (contextmesh/resolve.py)
      execution-000003.json  contextmesh.execution v1 (contextmesh/execute.py)
      runledger-000003.json  contextmesh.runledger v1 (contextmesh/execute.py)

The generation manifest is the join, and it is the only place that can check the
invariants the companions cannot see on their own. Session v1 held graph and
resolver; v2 adds the execution plan and its run ledger.

**Generations, because a session gets overwritten.** A save never overwrites a
live companion. It writes a whole new generation under new names, and only then
publishes ``session-000NNN.json``. The generation manifest is the commit:

    crash before publication  ->  the previous generation is still named, intact
    crash during publication  ->  one manifest or the other, never half of one
    crash after publication   ->  the new generation is named, and complete

Superseded generations are deleted after publication, so an interrupted save costs
disk rather than correctness.
